  abstract = {{Network virtualization environment (VNE) affords great business flexibility
	to the customers and the providers as multiple providers can jointly
	support a customer's virtual network. Under the current network model,
	a group of Infrastructure Providers (InPs) peer with each other to
	provide a packaged deal. Such a business arrangement is not customer-driven,
	does not promote fair market competition and does not ensure cost
	minimization. Furthermore, the on-demand nature of virtual networks
	requires efficient and automated service negotiation and contracting.
	In this paper, we present V-Mart. To the InPs, V-Mart offers an environment
	to participate in a faithful and fair competition over the VN resources;
	and to the SPs, it offers a customer-driven virtual resource partitioning
	and contracting engine. V-Mart uses a two-stage Vickrey auction model
	that is strategy-proof, flexible to diverse InP pricing models, and
	functions over heterogenous multi-commodity market that characterizes
	the NVE. Through analysis and simulation we show the flexibility
	and effectiveness of V-Mart.}},
